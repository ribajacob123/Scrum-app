# Unity3D Orbital Camera Control
These two scripts allow the player to control an orbital camera that can track a moving object, or be moved around using the keyboard. The player can also control the radius of the cameras orbit with the scroll wheel or two set keys.

## Using In-Game
The right mouse button controls the rotation of the camera: Dragging upwards rotates the camera to look from below, while dragging to the right spins the camera round to the left. Four defined keys, such as W, A, S and D, can be used to traverse the camera across the map. The scroll bar can be used to change the radius of the cameras orbit, as can two defined keys, such as E and Q. Finally, you can click on an object to track it. This follows the object as it moves, but you cna still control the rotation and the radius of the cameras orbit. Pressing any of the movement keys breaks out of this tracking mode.
